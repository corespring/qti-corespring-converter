Apollo 11 put the first human beings on the Moon. Both the Soviet Union and the United States worked hard to study the Moon. U.S. astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were the first to set foot on the Moon. Their partner, Michael Collins, flew the spaceship.</p><br/></partBlock></div><div><partBlock identifier="4" type="content"><p class="kds-indent"> Neil Armstrong, the Commander of the Apollo 11 mission, was born in Ohio in 1930. He was a pilot from a young age. Armstrong studied aeronautical engineering. He also served as a Navy pilot during the Korean War. After that, he signed on with NASA, or the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. His space career intensified when he joined the Astronaut Program in 1962. Armstrong's first noteworthy space mission was in 1966.</p><br/></partBlock></div><div><partBlock identifier="5" type="content"><p class="kds-indent"> Buzz Aldrin, the Lunar Module Pilot for the mission, had a background similar to Armstrong's. He attended West Point Military Academy, studied engineering, and served in the Korean War. He joined NASA's Astronaut Program and his first spacewalk was in 1966.</p><br/></partBlock></div><div><partBlock identifier="6" type="content"><p class="kds-indent"> The third astronaut on Apollo 11 was Michael Collins. He piloted the spacecraft while Armstrong and Aldrin walked on the Moon. Collins had also attended West Point and performed a spacewalk before his Apollo 11 mission.</p><br/></partBlock></div><div><partBlock identifier="7" type="content"><p class="kds-indent"> These three NASA astronauts were not the first astronauts to study the Moon. The United States and the Soviet Union both started exploring space long before Apollo 11. Their early work made Apollo 11 possible.</p><br/></partBlock></div><div><partBlock identifier="8" type="content"><p class="kds-indent"> In the 1950s, the Soviet Union launched a successful space mission called Sputnik. They also sent the first dog into orbit in 1957. In addition, their Luna 2 became the first spacecraft to land on the Moon. At the same time, the U.S. launched two spaceships, Ranger 4 and Ranger 7, to take pictures of the Moon's surface. These two U.S. spaceships did not have human passengers on them. All of these missions collected important information that Apollo 11 needed.</p><br/></partBlock></div><div><partBlock identifier="9" type="content"><p class="kds-indent"> In 1961, President John F. Kennedy vowed that, by the end of the decade, a U.S. man would walk on the Moon. This was quite a challenge for NASA. Both the U.S. and the Soviet Union then sent astronauts into space. Soviet Yuri Gagarin was the first man to orbit space. The U.S.'s Alan Shepard followed after him. The Soviets also sent the first woman into space in 1963. Then, U.S. astronaut Jim McDivitt completed the first successful spacewalk in 1965.</p><br/></partBlock></div><div><partBlock identifier="10" type="content"><p class="kds-indent"> Finally, the U.S. &quot;landed&quot; a major victory with Apollo 11. Apollo 11 launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on July 16, 1969. Over 3000 journalists, 7000 dignitaries, and half a million tourists were there to witness it. Many also watched on television. </p><br/></partBlock></div><div><partBlock identifier="11" type="content"><p class="kds-indent"> Apollo 11 consisted of three parts: the Command Module, the Lunar Module, and the Service Module. The Command Module, nicknamed Columbia, was the cabin that carried the three men. It was the only part that made it back to Earth. The Lunar Module, nicknamed the Eagle, was what Aldrin and Armstrong landed on the Moon in. The Service Module contained the source of electricity, water, and oxygen for the Command Module. </p><br/></partBlock></div><div><partBlock identifier="12" type="content"><p class="kds-indent"> Apollo 11 took three days to reach the Moon. It landed in the Sea of Tranquility. This is a large, dark plain on the Moon caused by volcanic activity. The men nearly had a catastrophic landing on the Moon but made it safely.</p><br/></partBlock></div><div><partBlock identifier="13" type="content"><p class="kds-indent"> Neil Armstrong walked on the Moon first. Armstrong put his feet on the Moon and said the emblematic words: &quot;That's one small step for man; one giant leap for mankind.&quot; He murmured these words as the largest television audience in history, over half a billion people, watched. </p><br/></partBlock></div><div><partBlock identifier="14" type="content"><p class="kds-indent"> Buzz Aldrin followed Armstrong onto the Moon a few minutes later. Both men performed scientific experiments and collected samples. They came home with almost 50 pounds of lunar material. These two men were out of the Lunar Module for less than three hours. They planted an American flag on the Moon. They also left a plaque that read &quot;Here men from the planet Earth set foot upon the Moon. July 1969 A.D. We came in peace for all mankind.&quot;</p><br/></partBlock></div><div><partBlock identifier="15" type="content"><p class="kds-indent"> The three astronauts returned to Earth and landed in the Pacific Ocean on July 24. They were placed in isolation for 21 days for fear of Moon germs. After their quarantine, they were treated with hero status with parades and celebrations. President Richard Nixon also presented all three with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.</p><br/></partBlock></div><div><partBlock identifier="16" type="content"><p class="kds-indent"> Shortly after Apollo 11's successful mission, 5 more missions and 12 more men landed on the Moon. American Pete Conrad even became the first man to exuberantly dance on the Moon in 1969.</p><br/></partBlock></div><div><partBlock identifier="17" type="content"><p class="kds-indent"> Today, space exploration continues. The U.S., India, China, and Japan are still studying space. Spacecrafts have traveled to Mercury, Venus, Saturn, and Jupiter. Many photos and samples have been collected. </p><br/></partBlock></div><div><partBlock identifier="18" type="content"><p class="kds-indent"> The United States secured an overwhelming victory the day those two brave men took one small step onto what Armstrong called the &quot;powdery&quot; surface of the Moon.</p><br/></partBlock></div></div><teacherInstructions><strong>TEACHER READS:</strong><br/><br/>Read and complete the task that follows.</teacherInstructions><graphicGapMatchInteraction responseIdentifier="RESPONSE1"><prompt visible="true"><strong>The boxes below each contain one dictionary definition.!!!csentity!!!160!!!csendentity!!!
