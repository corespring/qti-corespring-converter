They had to use their memory and listening skills to share information with future tribe members. This is how storytelling was born. Storytelling has been around for a very long time. No one knows when the first story was told. We do know that storytelling happens in every culture. Even though every culture has a form of storytelling, the meanings, themes, and styles may change from place to place. Even today, stories are used to amuse, teach, and explain. Storytelling was used as a way to have fun hundreds of years before books, plays, and movies ever existed.</p>\n   </partblock>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n   <partblock identifier=\"6\" type=\"content\">\n    <p class=\"indent\">Some believe storytelling started as a way to help explain the fears and questions of people. Small groups of families would tell these stories. Over time, more families of people came together to form bigger groups, called clans or tribes. In some groups, it became one person's job to keep the stories of the tribe or clan. These people were called storytellers. The storytellers had to keep the people interested. This was very important because they wanted the stories to be remembered by their group. They hoped that one day one of the listeners would become the new storyteller. Sometimes, storytellers would travel to other groups and tell their stories along the way. They would also learn new stories from the groups of people they visited. After some time, the storyteller would come home and share his or her new stories with their group. This caused the spread of stories all over the world.</p>\n   </partblock>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n   <partblock identifier=\"7\" type=\"content\">\n    <p class=\"indent\">Storytellers told many different types of stories for many different reasons. These types included myths, fairy tales, epic adventures, trickster tales, and fables. There are also stories that tried to explain events and weather, like earthquakes and lightning that may not have made sense to people a long time ago. These stories were sometimes unlikely, but tried to explain why these things happened. They were also fun to listen to. There are different reasons for each type of story, and many different types are used in each culture.</p>\n   </partblock>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n   <partblock identifier=\"8\" type=\"content\">\n    <p class=\"indent\">Being able to share our stories with each other is one thing that makes us different from all other animals on the planet. It is no wonder that people around the world still love to hear stories today, much like they did a long time ago.</p>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n   </partblock>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n   <partblock identifier=\"9\" type=\"content\">\n    <div class=\"center\">\n     <strong>Source 2</strong>\n    </div>\n    <br/>You found an article written by a Native American historian.

Native Americans still tell stories today like they did a long time ago. Native American stories try to explain and teach about the world we live in. Their stories honor all parts of life, including animals and plants, as well as family members that have passed. They also tell stories about how the world was made and why natural things happened.</p>\n   </partblock>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n   <partblock identifier=\"12\" type=\"content\">\n    <p class=\"indent\">Native American storytellers were called shamans. Shamans told stories and helped heal sick people.

Animals in Native American stories did not act like normal animals. They acted almost human. They would think and talk. Some of these animals were called &quot;wisdom animals.&quot; They would share what they knew with the shaman. The shaman had to travel to other groups to share his stories because not all people could talk to the wisdom animals.</p>\n   </partblock>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n   <partblock identifier=\"14\" type=\"content\">\n    <p class=\"indent\">Native Americans also used music, song, and dance in their stories. For example, one tribe would do spiritual dances to tell stories. Sometimes stories were told in song with music. The music and dancing was meant to amuse the listeners while they heard the stories.</p>\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n   </partblock>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n   <partblock identifier=\"15\" type=\"content\">\n    <div class=\"center\">\n     <strong>Source 3</strong>\n    </div>\n    <br/>You have found an article written by a history expert.

Storytelling is seen as an art in this culture. Africans are proud to share their stories. Stories are meant to be a performance and will usually include dance and music. </p>\n   </partblock>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n   <partblock identifier=\"18\" type=\"content\">\n    <p class=\"indent\">Griots, or the female Griotte, are the storytellers in African culture. There is usually only one storyteller for each village. If any other village tries to steal a storyteller from another, this could start a war. Griots are in charge of keeping the history from their time and sharing this information. They must also remember the stories told to them by their family members. Griots also serve the king and his family. They also sing at special events in the village.</p> \n   </partblock>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n   <partblock identifier=\"19\" type=\"content\">\n    <p class=\"indent\">West African stories tell of shared knowledge and help teach lessons about what is right and wrong. There is a common theme of wit, independence, and courage. Stories in West African culture are usually proverbs, epic narrations, genealogies, or songs. Proverbs are stories that share knowledge, truth, ideas, and life lessons. Epic narrations tell the story of a real hero that played an important part in the tribe's history. Even though the person may have been real, the events in the story may be hero–like to show greater importance. Genealogies share the history of the group. These are usually sung by Griots while playing a musical instrument. They usually include facts such as numbers, dates, and important names. Songs are a huge part of African culture and their storytelling. Songs are sung in all parts of life.</p>\n   </partblock>\n  </div>\n </div>\n <corespring-teacher-instructions id=\"teacher-instructions-372810155\"/>\n <p class=\"prompt\"><strong>Mark the boxes to match each source with the information it mentions.  Some pieces of information may have more than one source marked.</strong></p>\n <corespring-match id=\"RESPONSE1\"/> \n</div>",
